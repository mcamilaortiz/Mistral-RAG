Technical Test for Machine Learning Engineer at Loka. 

There is a local solution and a AWS Solution. To test the local solution, go to the file README.md in the folder and follow up the steps. 

In the documentation you can find the purposed workflow, the model and the solution implemented.  

The AWS Solution has not been tested due to some limitations in my personal account.
