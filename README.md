Technical Test for Machine Learning Engineer at Loka. 

There is a local solution and a AWS Solution. To test the local solution, go to the file README.md in the folder and follow up the steps. 

In the documentation you can find the purposed workflow, the model and the solution implemented.  

In the cloud solution, I purposed using AWS Services. There is a template of the purposed stack and a SageMaker notebook, this one has not been tested due to limitations in my personal account, anyway, its parameters are setted up in the same way that the local solution.
