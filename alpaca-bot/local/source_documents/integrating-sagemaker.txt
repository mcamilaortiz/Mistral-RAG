<h1>How Amazon SageMaker uses AWS Secrets Manager<a name="integrating-sagemaker"></a></h1>

<p>SageMaker is a fully managed machine learning service. With SageMaker, data scientists and developers can quickly and easily build and train machine learning models, and then directly deploy them into a production-ready hosted environment. It provides an integrated Jupyter authoring notebook instance for easy access to your data sources for exploration and analysis, so you don't have to manage servers. </p>

<p>You can associate Git repositories with your Jupyter notebook instances to save your notebooks in a source control environment that persists even if you stop or delete your notebook instance. You can manage your private repositories credentials using Secrets Manager. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/nbi-git-repo.html">Associate Git Repositories with Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instances</a> in the <em>Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide</em>.</p>
