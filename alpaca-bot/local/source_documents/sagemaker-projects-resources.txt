<p>On the project details tab, you can view the following entities associated with the project.
+ Repositories: Code repositories (repos) associated with this project. If you use a SageMaker-provided template when you create your project, it creates a AWS CodeCommit repo or a third-party Git repo. For more information about CodeCommit, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/welcome.html">What is AWS CodeCommit</a>.
+ Pipelines: SageMaker ML pipelines that define steps to prepare data, train, and deploy models. For information about SageMaker ML pipelines, see <a href="pipelines-build.md">Create and Manage SageMaker Pipelines</a>.
+ Experiments: One or more Amazon SageMaker Autopilot experiments associated with the project. For information about Autopilot, see <a href="autopilot-automate-model-development.md">Automate model development with Amazon SageMaker Autopilot</a>.
+ Model groups: Groups of model versions that were created by pipeline executions in the project. For information about model groups, see <a href="model-registry-model-group.md">Create a Model Group</a>.
+ Endpoints: SageMaker endpoints that host deployed models for real-time inference. When a model version is approved, it is deployed to an endpoint.
