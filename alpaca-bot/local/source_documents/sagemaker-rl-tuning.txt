<h1>Hyperparameter Tuning with Amazon SageMaker RL<a name="sagemaker-rl-tuning"></a></h1>

<p>You can run a hyperparameter tuning job to optimize hyperparameters for Amazon SageMaker RL. The Roboschool example in the sample notebooks in the <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/tree/master/reinforcement_learning">SageMaker examples repository</a> shows how you can do this with RL Coach. The launcher script shows how you can abstract parameters from the Coach preset file and optimize them.</p>
