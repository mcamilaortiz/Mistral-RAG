<h1>Use Algorithm and Model Package Resources<a name="sagemaker-mkt-buy"></a></h1>

<p>You can create algorithms and model packages as resources in your Amazon SageMaker account, and you can find and subscribe to algorithms and model packages on AWS Marketplace.</p>

<p>Use algorithms to:
+ Run training jobs. For information, see <a href="sagemaker-mkt-algo-train.md">Use an Algorithm to Run a Training Job</a>.
+ Run hyperparameter tuning jobs. For information, see <a href="sagemaker-mkt-algo-tune.md">Use an Algorithm to Run a Hyperparameter Tuning Job</a>.
+ Create model packages. After you use an algorithm resource to run a training job or a hyperparameter tuning job, you can use the model artifacts that these jobs output along with the algorithm to create a model package. For information, see <a href="sagemaker-mkt-create-model-package.md">Create a Model Package Resource</a>.
<strong>Note</strong><br />
If you subscribe to an algorithm on AWS Marketplace, you must create a model package before you can use it to get inferences by creating hosted endpoint or running a batch transform job.</p>

<p>Use model packages to:
+ Create models that you can use to get real-time inference or run batch transform jobs. For information, see <a href="sagemaker-mkt-model-pkg-model.md">Use a Model Package to Create a Model</a>.
+ Create hosted endpoints to get real-time inference. For information, see <a href="ex1-model-deployment.md#ex1-deploy-model">Deploy the Model to SageMaker Hosting Services</a>.
+ Create batch transform jobs. For information, see <a href="ex1-model-deployment.md#ex1-batch-transform">(Optional) Make Prediction with Batch Transform</a>.</p>
