<h1>AWS::SageMaker::ModelExplainabilityJobDefinition StoppingCondition<a name="aws-properties-sagemaker-modelexplainabilityjobdefinition-stoppingcondition"></a></h1>

<p>Specifies a limit to how long a model training job or model compilation job can run. It also specifies how long a managed spot training job has to complete. When the job reaches the time limit, SageMaker ends the training or compilation job. Use this API to cap model training costs.</p>

<p>To stop a training job, SageMaker sends the algorithm the <code>SIGTERM</code> signal, which delays job termination for 120 seconds. Algorithms can use this 120-second window to save the model artifacts, so the results of training are not lost. </p>

<p>The training algorithms provided by SageMaker automatically save the intermediate results of a model training job when possible. This attempt to save artifacts is only a best effort case as model might not be in a state from which it can be saved. For example, if training has just started, the model might not be ready to save. When saved, this intermediate data is a valid model artifact. You can use it to create a model with <code>CreateModel</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong><br />
The Neural Topic Model (NTM) currently does not support saving intermediate model artifacts. When training NTMs, make sure that the maximum runtime is sufficient for the training job to complete.</p>

<h2>Syntax<a name="aws-properties-sagemaker-modelexplainabilityjobdefinition-stoppingcondition-syntax"></a></h2>

<p>To declare this entity in your AWS CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:</p>

<h3>JSON<a name="aws-properties-sagemaker-modelexplainabilityjobdefinition-stoppingcondition-syntax.json"></a></h3>

<p><code>
{
  "[MaxRuntimeInSeconds](#cfn-sagemaker-modelexplainabilityjobdefinition-stoppingcondition-maxruntimeinseconds)" : Integer
}
</code></p>

<h3>YAML<a name="aws-properties-sagemaker-modelexplainabilityjobdefinition-stoppingcondition-syntax.yaml"></a></h3>

<p><code>
  [MaxRuntimeInSeconds](#cfn-sagemaker-modelexplainabilityjobdefinition-stoppingcondition-maxruntimeinseconds): Integer
</code></p>

<h2>Properties<a name="aws-properties-sagemaker-modelexplainabilityjobdefinition-stoppingcondition-properties"></a></h2>

<p><code>MaxRuntimeInSeconds</code>  <a name="cfn-sagemaker-modelexplainabilityjobdefinition-stoppingcondition-maxruntimeinseconds"></a>
The maximum length of time, in seconds, that a training or compilation job can run before it is stopped.<br />
For compilation jobs, if the job does not complete during this time, a <code>TimeOut</code> error is generated. We recommend starting with 900 seconds and increasing as necessary based on your model.<br />
For all other jobs, if the job does not complete during this time, SageMaker ends the job. When <code>RetryStrategy</code> is specified in the job request, <code>MaxRuntimeInSeconds</code> specifies the maximum time for all of the attempts in total, not each individual attempt. The default value is 1 day. The maximum value is 28 days.<br />
The maximum time that a <code>TrainingJob</code> can run in total, including any time spent publishing metrics or archiving and uploading models after it has been stopped, is 30 days.<br />
