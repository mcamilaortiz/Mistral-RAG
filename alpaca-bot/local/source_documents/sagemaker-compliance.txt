<h1>Compliance Validation for Amazon SageMaker<a name="sagemaker-compliance"></a></h1>

<p>Third-party auditors assess the security and compliance of Amazon SageMaker as part of multiple AWS compliance programs. These include SOC, PCI, FedRAMP, HIPAA, and others.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong><br />
If your use of Amazon SageMaker Studio in AWS East/West regions is subject to FedRAMP Moderate, use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to configure authentication for Studio. AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) is currently not in scope for FedRAMP Moderate (East/West).</p>
